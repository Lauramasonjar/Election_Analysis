# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the elcetion audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total.
8. Determine the county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary

- This code can be modified to find out the popularity of candidates in any respective county with their high and low votes with percentages.

- If we have population data of each county, we can also find out how many voters turned up for the election.

- We can calculate mean, median and mode with respect to candidates votes and find out who the winner candidate is for that specific county.

- It can be useful for any other elections simply by changing the variable of county to state.

- No matter the number of candidates or counties, the code can be used to perform the Election Audit and can be valuable to the board.

- We can analyze a different dataset by using other CSV files and the variables can be modified according to the new dataset.
